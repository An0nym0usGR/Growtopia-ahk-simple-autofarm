# Growtopia-ahk-simple-autofarm

Before you start reading, i might aswell inform you that English isnt my first language so excuse me if you see any grammar mistake etc. (you shouldnt even care about that anyways tbh)

I've made this small and simple but really effective (at least for me) code, literally from using Chat GPT. 

This script allows sends keys to GrowTopia while the window is inactive, that means you can absolutely do anything else and leave it breaking blocks in the background!

Currently I'm using it to auto-clear worlds and all i have to do is to check every 1-2 minutes where I'm at in case the row I'm clearing is done, so i can move all the way to the left because the script uses key "d" and "space" only, nothing else. Its that simple.

Little Q/A

"is it safe?" 
- I cant guarantee 100% that its safe to use but im using ahk in multiple games that are multiplayer and nothing ever happened. Ahk is really safe and 99% undetectable unless you code it to change game files etc.
P.s: Im using this code 2 days now and nothing happened so far.

"How can I make myself "safe" while using the script?" 
- A perfect idea to hide yourself while using this is 2 options, either place of course in the world a Signal Jammer if you have one already, otherwise just wrench the WL and make it min. level 124 so no one can enter this world.

That's all I can say so far. I'm obviously no expert at anything don't get me wrong... I dont have any coding experience or anything tbh i just use common sense xd

-- ALWAYS USE PICKAXE OF COURSE -- 
-- GRAPHICS AT THE LOWEST SETTING SO YOU WON'T USE THAT MUCH INTERNET & REDUCE LAG --
-- IF YOU'RE MISSING BLOCKS (LEAVING THEM BEHIND) MAYBE YOU CAN TRY REMOVING AIR ROBS BUT IDK HOW EFFECTIVE THAT WOULD BE --
